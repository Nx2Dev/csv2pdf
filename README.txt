I have provided three scientific abstracts to the script, with the following columns:
Title,Presenting Author,Presenting Author Affiliation,Author1,Affiliation1,Author2,Affiliation2,Author3,Affiliation3,Description

The Python script handles each column and will give you a normal/plain PDF format (check the output.pdf).

You can edit the script to achieve another format of the provided info.

-Cheers
